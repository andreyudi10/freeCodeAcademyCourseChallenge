// React: Render State in the User Interface Another Way

// There is another way to access state in a component. In the render() method, before the return statement, you can write JavaScript directly. For example, you could declare functions, access data from state or props, perform computations on this data, and so on. Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the return statement.

//In the MyComponent render method, define a const called name and set it equal to the name value in the component's state. Because you can write JavaScript directly in this part of the code, you don't have to enclose this reference in curly braces.
// Next, in the return statement, render this value in an h1 tag using the variable name. Remember, you need to use the JSX syntax (curly braces for JavaScript) in the return statement.

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        name: 'freeCodeCamp'
      }
    }
    render() {
      // Change code below this line
      const name=this.state.name
      // Change code above this line
      return (
        <div>
          { /* Change code below this line */ }
          <h1>{name}</h1>
  
          { /* Change code above this line */ }
        </div>
      );
    }
  };
  
//   this.setState({
//     username: 'Lewis'
//   });
//   React expects you to never modify state directly, instead always use this.setState() when state changes occur. Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the setState method can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the setState method which provides a way around this problem. This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind! Please consult the React documentation for further details.

//   There is a button element in the code editor which has an onClick() handler. This handler is triggered when the button receives a click event in the browser, and runs the handleClick method defined on MyComponent. Within the handleClick method, update the component state using this.setState(). Set the name property in state to equal the string React Rocks!.  
//   Click the button and watch the rendered state update. Don't worry if you don't fully understand how the click handler code works at this point. It's covered in upcoming challenges.
  
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = {
        name: 'Initial State'
      };
      this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    }
    handleClick() {
      // Change code below this line
      this.setState({name:
      'React Rocks!'})
      // Change code above this line
    }
    render() {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
          <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
        </div>
      );
    }
  };
